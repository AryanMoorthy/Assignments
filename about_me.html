                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    Hi, I’m <span style="color: red;">Aryan</span>— a curious learner, driven problem-solver, and someone who believes that hard work and a sharp mind can turn any challenge into an opportunity. I’m passionate about science, problem-solving, and helping others, whether that’s through teaching, sharing ideas, or simply offering the right nudge of motivation at the right time. Outside of academics, I thrive on learning new skills, exploring innovative ideas, and pushing myself to grow — because I believe the best version of me is always the one I’m working toward next.
